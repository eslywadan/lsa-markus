## 📝 How to Report in Your Research Paper

### Option 1: Methodology Section

```
Topic Selection Methodology

We identified background and distinctive topics through multi-criteria analysis:
(1) explained variance ratio, indicating the discriminative power of each topic;
(2) average prevalence across documents, measuring how commonly the topic appears;
and (3) semantic coherence of top terms.

Topic 0 emerged as background context in both periods, characterized by low
explained variance (2006-2015: 1.22%; 2016-2025: 1.82%) and high prevalence
(2006-2015: 0.44; 2016-2025: 0.46), appearing consistently across all documents.

Topic 1 represented the primary distinctive pattern in both periods, with high
explained variance (2006-2015: 13.08%; 2016-2025: 13.09%), effectively separating
documents containing specialized themes from the general corpus.
```

### Option 2: Results Section

```
Period 1 (2006-2015):

Topic 0 (explained variance: 1.22%, prevalence: 0.44) represents the common
background context shared across all 13 documents, focusing on indigenous tribal
culture (部落, 泰雅族, 原住民, 文化). This topic's low variance but high
prevalence indicates it captures baseline themes present throughout the period.

Topic 1 (explained variance: 13.08%) captures the most distinctive pattern,
primarily related to safety incidents involving police and hunting activities
(警方, 現場, 打獵). This topic effectively separates incident reports (6/13
documents) from other news types, demonstrating strong discriminative power.

Period 2 (2016-2025):

Topic 0 (explained variance: 1.82%, prevalence: 0.46) represents the common
background context, with emphasis shifting toward government administration and
tourism management (部落, 公所, 縣府, 遊客). The consistent low variance and
high prevalence across all 12 documents indicates stable baseline themes.

Topic 1 (explained variance: 13.09%) captures emergency evacuation events at
Konsi tribe (控溪 部落, 撤離, 溢流), appearing strongly in 8/12 documents.
This topic's high explained variance demonstrates its effectiveness in
differentiating crisis-related coverage from routine reporting.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

### Explained Variance
- **What it measures**: How much variation in the data each topic captures
- **High variance (Topic 1: ~13%)**: Strong discriminative power, separates documents effectively
- **Low variance (Topic 0: ~1-2%)**: Captures consistent patterns across documents

### Prevalence
- **What it measures**: Average absolute weight of a topic across all documents
- **High prevalence (Topic 0: 0.44-0.46)**: Topic appears commonly/ubiquitously
- **Moderate prevalence (Topic 1: 0.26-0.28)**: Topic appears in subset of documents

### Document Coverage
- **Background topic (13/13, 12/12)**: Present in ALL documents
- **Distinctive topic (6/13, 8/12)**: Present in specialized subset

## ✅ Best Practices (From Your Analysis)

### Your Topic Selection Methodology is VALID because:

1. ✅ **Clear domain context**: All articles about Jianshi Township
2. ✅ **Shared background**: Indigenous culture and local government appear consistently
3. ✅ **Distinctive events**: Emergency incidents and specific tribal events separate documents
4. ✅ **Empirically verified**: Pattern confirmed in both time periods
5. ✅ **Semantic coherence**: Terms make intuitive sense for their roles

### When Reporting, DO:
- ✅ Mention multi-criteria selection (variance + prevalence + semantic coherence)
- ✅ Report specific metrics (variance %, prevalence values, coverage)
- ✅ Explain what each topic represents semantically
- ✅ Note that pattern was verified empirically

### When Reporting, DON'T:
- ❌ Claim it's a universal rule
- ❌ Use variance alone without checking prevalence
- ❌ Assume without verification

## 🎯 Quick Decision Flowchart

```
Need to select topics for interpretation?
    │
    ├─→ Check LOWEST variance topic:
    │   • Is prevalence > 0.3? ✓
    │   • Appears in most/all docs? ✓
    │   • Terms represent common context? ✓
    │   └─→ YES to all = Background context
    │
    └─→ Check HIGHEST variance topic:
        • Explained variance high (>10%)? ✓
        • Appears in subset of docs? ✓
        • Terms represent specific events? ✓
        └─→ YES to all = Distinctive pattern
```
